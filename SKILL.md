# Weekly Report Pack

## What problem it solves

Writing status reports isn't about typing — it's about **organization**: which of the 20 things you did this week actually matter, how to quantify wins without sounding like a brag sheet, and how to surface problems without looking helpless. This pack turns "scattered traces → structured report" into a repeatable pipeline.

## Workflow

1. **Feed**: dump this week's work traces — chat logs, checked todos, calendar, git commits, notes. Any format.
2. **Pick template**: `daily` (3-part) / `weekly` (5-part) / `monthly` (business view). First run: confirm the audience (direct manager / cross-team / exec) — audience controls depth and tone.
3. **Generate**, conclusion-first:
   - **Core progress** (max 3 items, each = result + number + impact)
   - **Key metrics** (WoW delta; if no data, suggest how to collect it)
   - **Issues & risks** (format: issue + mitigation already taken + support needed — never a naked complaint)
   - **Next week** (deliverable-oriented, dependencies flagged)
4. **Format**: Markdown / email body / Slack or Teams message.

## Quality rules

- Every progress item must answer "so what" — what it means for the team/project.
- Numbers first: never write "significantly improved" when a number exists.
- Every issue must carry an action, otherwise it goes to "observations".
- Compare against last week's report to avoid re-reporting the same progress (user pastes last week's version).

## Boundaries

Never fabricate data; unprovided metrics marked as [TBD]. Neutral wording on other people's performance.
